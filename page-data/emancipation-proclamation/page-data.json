In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.

When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.`));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. “Whenever you feel…","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Great Gatsby","userDate":"12 December 1922","date":"1922-12-12T10:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"category":null,"excerpt":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/d79bd/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/0079a/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.jpg 930w,\n/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/d79bd/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.jpg 1500w","sizes":"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"}}},"author":[]}},"relatedPosts":{"totalCount":9,"edges":[{"node":{"id":"989afa26-2c78-5d4f-9508-5f384db8cdb1","timeToRead":4,"excerpt":"The SAM Pattern as an alternative approach to widely adopted Frontend architectures.
