excerpt: 'I recently found this interesting Movie exploring the Gender Gap in Coding. The movie tries to find explanations for the unequal distribution of people working in tech jobs/coding identifying them self as a male regarding female or non-binary people.'

I studied Mathematics and Physics and I worked the last 4 years in different roles in the IT industry. The huge dis-balance in the rate of male vs. female employees or researchers in math and tech is an undeniable fact. Fewer women than men studying math or IT subjects and even less ending up in a technical role in IT industry.

I’m aware of photographs taken from me, being three years old, wiring a battery to a bulb. Or being 6-year-old and programming an Atari ST with Logo. I’ve always been the guy they asked to program the neighbor’s video recorder, and I did so, despite having ever used one since my parents didn’t own one by themselves. Remembering myself as a kid that always experienced natural attraction and fascination for electronic devices and applications, I find it difficult to say if I stuck to IT and electronics because my parents provided the right toys to me or if they provided them to me because they realized that they caught my attention with them. But undeniably there is a difference in the response and treatment of society to children interfering with technology regarding their gender.

And there is a strong dominance of male persons in the tech industry and they are very often stabilizing and defending it by denying female employees the technical expertise to understand or solve a certain technical problem. For me as a developer, I would really like to improve in acting and responding in the right way in those circumstances. But building awareness of the existing problems and examining their roots is what I believe is the first step to address this problem. And I found this movie an interesting contribution to this problem:

I stumbled over it, while I was exploring the online services from Berlin public libraries. Just for the case that you are living in Berlin, it’s worth paying the 10 Eur annual fee to gain access to it.
