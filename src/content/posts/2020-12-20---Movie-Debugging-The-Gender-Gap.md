excerpt: 'I recently found this interesting Movie exploring the Gender Gap in Coding. The movie tries to find explanations for the unequal distribution of people working in tech jobs/coding identifying them selfs as a male with respect to female or non-binary people.'

Why is the job of a developer/coder associated with the male gender

I studied Mathematics and Physics and I've worked the last 4 years in different roles in the IT industry. It is an undeniable fact that there is a huge disbalance in the rate of male vs. female employees or researchers. There are less women then men studiying math or IT subjects and even less ending up in a technical role in IT industry.
I remember from myself that I've always experienced some natural attarction and fascination for electronical devices and applications. There exists photos from me being three years old, wiring a battery to a bulb. Or being 6 year old and programming an Atari ST with Logo. I've always beenm the guy who have been asked to program the neighbours video recorder, and I managed to do so, even so I've never used one before, since my parents didn't own one by themselfs. I find it difficult to say if I sticked to IT and electronics because my parents provided the right toys to me or if they provided them to me because they realized that they catched my attention with them. But certainly, there is a different repsonse and treatment of society to children interfering with technology in respect to their gender.
And there is a strong dominance of male persons in tech industry and very often it is strengthened and defended by denying female emploeyees the neccessary technical expertise to understand or solve a certain technical problem. For me as a developer, I would really like to improve in acting and responding in the right way in those circumstances. But building awareness of the existing problems and examining their roots is what I believe is the first step to address this problem. And I found this movie an interesting contribution to this problem:
