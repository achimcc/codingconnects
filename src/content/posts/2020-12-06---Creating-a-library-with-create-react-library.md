I show how to set up a react library which I publish to Github, so I can import it into a React project as a dependency. There is a powerful tool which allows to do a boilerplate approach to build a library: [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library).

Further, I wish to implement unit tests which allow me to test my libraryâ€™s components.

First, we install [create-react-library]:

```
npm install -g create-react-library
```

We create a boilerplate react library by typing:

```
create-react-library
```

First, we choose a name for the package. Since I prefer to focus on the technical details of setting up a library together with a testing framework, I decide to develop a simple Clock component, whose only purpose is to receive hours and minutes as props and to render the time out of it.

Therefore, I enter 'achimcc-clock' as package name, and 'A simple React clock' for the package description. Next, I enter my GitHub user name (achimcc) and the path to my Github repository (achimcc/achimcc-clock). For the license, I just hit return to publish my module under the MIT license. I select yarn as the package manager and typescript as a template, since I develop a TypeScript app:

That's it, we've created a React TypeScript library. Next we start the development server of the library with:

```
cd achimcc-clock && yarn start
```

The library has an example component included and also an example app which imports this component. Hence, we can now open a new shell, and type:

```
cd achimcc-clock/example && yarn start
```

To start a watch script which starts a dev server. Now our pre-made app, importing and using our pre-made component, we can access it locally by our web-browser on https://localhost:3000

Next, we can add a new file clock.tsx to the source directory of our library, implementing a simple clock:

```javascript
// /src/clock.tsx:

import * as React from 'react'

interface Props {
  hours: number
  minutes: number
}

const append = (digit: number): string => {
  if (digit < 10) return `0${digit}`
  else return `${digit}`
}

const clockStyles = {
  padding: '6px',
  height: 'auto',
  border: '4px solid',
  borderRadius: '10px',
  display: 'inline-block',
  margin: '1em',
  fontSize: '2em',
  fontWeight: 'bold' as 'bold'
}

const Clock = ({ hours, minutes }: Props) => {
  return (
    <div style={clockStyles}>
      {append(hours)}:{append(minutes)}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Clock
```

I used inline styling here for the CSS definitions. An alternative would be to use CSS modules. But then, we would need to import the css definitions in our project, together with our library components. For larger projects, the best solution is using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

We add to lines to index.tsx, since we want to export our new clock component:

```javascript
// /src/index.tsx:

import React from 'react';
import { ExampleComponent, Clock } from 'achimcc-clock';
import 'achimcc-clock/dist/index.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ExampleComponent text="Create React Library Example ðŸ˜„" />
      <h1>Our new Clock component:</h1>
      <Clock hours={12} minutes={33} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Finally, we open the App.tsx file under example/App.tsx so we can import and render our new Clock component besides the pre-made component:

```javascript
// /example/src/App.tsx:

import React from 'react';

import { ExampleComponent, Clock } from 'clock';
import 'achimcc-clock/dist/index.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ExampleComponent text="Create React Library Example ðŸ˜„" />
      <Clock hours={12} minutes={33} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

That's it:

Now we are ready to deploy the library to GitHub. For this, I first create a new repository on my GitHub account: https://github.com/achimcc/achimcc-clock.git.

Then I add the origin to my local project:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/achimcc/achimcc-clock.git
```

### Publishing to npm

Now we want to make the library available as a npm repo. For this, we first need a npm account, which can get from here: [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Then, in the libraryâ€™s root directory, type:

```
yarn login
```

Now enter your username and password. Then we can publish the library, by typing:

```
yarn deploy
```

### Importing the component to your project

The published component is available and can we can import it into our projects! I can even import it into my Gatsby Blog with [MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/), by typing:

```jsx
import { Clock } from 'achimcc-clock';

<Clock hours={12} minutes={15} />;
```

Here it is:

import {Clock} from "achimcc-clock"

<Clock hours={12} minutes={15} />
